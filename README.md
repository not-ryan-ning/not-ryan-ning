# Hey, I'm Ryan! 👋🏻

### I like to code and go bouldering. 

If you know me, I've tried to introduce you to climbing at least once.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning [Genetic Algorithms](github.com/not-ryan-ning/Genetic-Algorithms), **Software Design**, **Theory of Computation**, and **Data Structures and Analysis**.
- ✨ I'm currently working on [Sphere](github.com/not-ryan-ning/Sphere) and **V4-5** problems. 
- 📫 Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-ning/)!
